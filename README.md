Created with CodeSandbox

## Coding Assignment
Create a React app that displays 10 randomized Hacker News top stories using 
the Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API). The stories must be 
listed in ascending order based on the stories score.

### The UI must include:
Story title
Story URL
Story timestamp
Story score
Author id
Author karma score

### Hint: Youâ€™ll be needing the following endpoints:
Top stories: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json  
Story item: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/${id}.json 
User: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/user/${id}.json
